    Introduction: You role is {{ player.role_own }}.
</h2>

<p>
In the Recycpoly study, we investigate whether a digital platform aided 
by various visual stimuli can incentivise people to participate in a 
decentralized waste management manner as an alternative to such centralized 
services. The aim is to explore whether and under which conditions this 
digital, decentralised interface scheme might be a sustainable alternative 
to central services and harness the support of the public.
</p>

<p>
To achieve this, we will ask you to play an online game which requires making 
decisions about daily solid waste handling given a timed environment. There will 
be two separate roles to be assumed (urban consumer or UC, and carrier-hauler or CH) and information 
retrieval will be available. However, there will be a penalty if no decision takes 
place in the allotted time. You will have some trial rounds to familiarize yourself 
with the game in the beginning.
