<h2>
    Introduction:
</h2>

<p>
In the Recycpoly study, we investigate whether a digital platform aided 
by various information stimuli can incentivize people to participate in a 
decentralized waste management manner as an alternative to such centralized 
services. The aim is to explore whether and under which conditions this 
digital, decentralized interface scheme might be a sustainable alternative 
to central services and harness the support of the public.
</p>

<p>
To achieve this, we will ask you to play an online game which requires making 
decisions about daily solid waste handling given a timed environment. There will 
be two separate roles to be assumed (urban consumer or UC, and carrier-hauler or CH), which 
will be randomly assigned to you, and further gameplay information 
retrieval might be available. The UC roles generate waste on each round/day and the CH roles 
handle it if possible. As a UC you automatically pay a default survival cost of supplies, through 
which you generate the waste. This cost drops the more you dispose through the decentralized waste 
handling alternative.
</p>

<p>
Your decisions, depending on your role, consist of the following:
<ul>
  <li>UC</li>
  <ul>
    <li>How many items to be stored</li>
    <li>How many items to be pushed to the decentralized platform to be exchanged with an available partner</li>
    <li>The desirable selling price per item pushed</li>
    <li>How many items to be disposed centrally (e.g. through municipal services)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>CH</li> 
  <ul>
    <li>How many items to be bought from those pushed to the decentralized platform by candidate UC partners</li>
    <li>The desirable buying price per item to be bought</li>
    <li>How many items from the ones bought to be sold to recycling entities (the greater the selling quantity, the greater the selling price per item)</li>
  </ul>
</ul> 

All you need to do is insert the appopriate number in the corresponding fields and click "next" for your actions to be
recorded. Note that you need to specify explicitly an action for all the items available for handling per round. 
All the data you need to figure your status so as to make an informed decision will be available on the page 
in question. Be mindful that there will be a penalty if no decision takes 
place in the allotted time. You will have some trial rounds to familiarize yourself 
with the game in the beginning.
