<h2>
    Introduction:
</h2>

<p>
In the Recycpoly study, we investigate whether a digital platform aided 
by various information stimuli can incentivize people to participate in
decentralized waste management as an alternative to centralized
services. The aim is to explore whether and under which conditions this 
digital, decentralized interface scheme might be a sustainable alternative 
to central services and harness the support of the public.
</p>

<p>
In this study, you make decisions about daily solid waste handling given a timed environment. There will
be two separate roles (urban consumer or UC, and carrier-hauler or CH), which
will be randomly assigned. The UC roles generate waste on each round/day and the CH roles
handle it if possible. As a UC you automatically pay a default survival cost of supplies, through
which you generate the waste. <b>This cost of survival drops the more UCs handle waste through the decentralized platform.</b>
</p>

<p>
Your decisions, depending on your role, consist of the following:
<ul>
  <li>UC (urban consumer)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>How many items to store</li>
    <li>How many items to push to the decentralized platform for selling</li>
    <li>The minimum acceptable selling price per item pushed</li>
  </ul>
  <li>CH (carrier-hauler)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>How many items to buy from those pushed to the decentralized platform by candidate UC partners</li>
    <li>The maximum acceptable buying price per item to be bought</li>
    <li>Whether to sell the items bought to recycling entities or to store them</li>
  </ul>
</ul> 

All you need to do is insert the appropriate number in the corresponding fields and click "next" for your actions to be
recorded. Note that you need to specify explicitly an action for all the items available for handling per round. 
All the data you need to make an informed decision will be available on the respective page. Be mindful that there will be a penalty if no decision takes
place in the allotted time. You will have some trial rounds to familiarize yourself 
with the game in the beginning.
