<h1>
    Recycpoly Manual
</h1> 

Firstly, you will be provided with a link in your Prolific recruitment page, from
which you can be directed to the game. Once in the game, you will assume a
role either of an “urban consumer”, denoted via UC, or of a “carrier-hauler”,
denoted via CH. In each role you are called to fill in certain fields with numbers
representing your actions (buying or selling depending on you role) 
in waste items (imagine any solid waste item and
assume that all are identical) and (experimental) dollars. Your objective is to
minimize your costs or/and make a profit overall. Your final balance, if positive,
is going to be translated to a bonus amounting up to 100% of your base pay.

<p>
    Imagine the rounds as days in real life. You begin with an initial
    balance enough to see you through the game by disposing all your waste through 
    the central manager. On each day you need to buy some minimal amount of goods
    to survive (this is done automatically), which cost $10/item. Your 
    initial balance should see you through these costs again. Additionally, the
    total amount of this cost is displayed on the decision page along with
    your balance, the total amount (5) you can store (capacity), you have stored,
    you must handle in the round, and the number of generated waste items
    resulting from your survival needs (5). You can either dispose the generated 
    waste through standard means (similar to a municipal rubbish bin) or participate 
    in a decentralized system by selling it to a mediator (CH), who is going to forward it to a
    recycling platform. Your survival costs can drop fivefold, depending on the waste
    item flow and the recycling process on the platform. Although you might
    notice this on each round's payoff, it is something you influence only indirectly, 
    as you would need other peers to act similarly (cooperate) so as to achieve this 
    effect at scale.
</p>

<p>
    What you need to decide is whether to store (if your capacity suffices)
    the waste items generated, whether to push them to the recycling platform
    or dispose them via the central manager (standard means).
</p>

<p>
    When opting for forwarding waste to the platform, you are essentially
    attempting to use the decentralized system for waste handling via a simple
    auction. In particular, what determines whether your items will be sold
    on the platform is the price you select as well as the demand for them. If
    you ask more than a CH is willing to pay for buying your items, they will
    not be sold. If no CH is willing to buy your items or there is no demand
    for them, then they are stored or, if there is no capacity left, automatically
    disposed via the central manager (standard means), which incurs a fixed
    fee of $25.    
</p>

<p>
    After you have completed your decisions you will have to wait until the
    other participants have completed their actions. Once they are done,
    you will be directed to the results page. There you will find a summary
    overview of your actions and the results. This includes how many items
    you have in storage, how many you did (and did not) manage to sell on
    the platform, your total payoff (including the survival costs), 
    to whom you sold, etc.    
</p>

<p>
    Note that all decisions need to be taken within a certain time window.
    <b>Decision inactivity incurs a monetary penalty of $35 on your balance.</b>

<h2 id="CH">The CH (Carrier-Hauler) Role</h2>

<p>
    Imagine the rounds as days in real life. You begin with an initial
    balance. On each day, you can buy items on a decentralized system for
    waste handling, if available, for a self-chosen price via a simple auction.
    Your maximum capacity (items your can carry overall) is 10.
    These items stem from the UCs in your group. On each day, they generate 
    waste items and can decide whether to store them, dispose them via
    standard means (similar to a municipal rubbish bin, no interaction with the platform)
    or forward and sell them on the platform for a self-chosen price. What 
    determines whether there are items available that you can buy is dependent
    on the price you ask for them and their supply by the UCs. If you are
    willing to buy the items for a price lower than a UC is willing to sell them
    for, then no transaction takes place. Consequently, if no UC exists meeting 
    this criterion you end up buying nothing in that round. Given that
    a transaction takes place, you have to commit to the externally defined
    deposit value ($1) for the waste of the good that the UC has paid for as a starting price.
    It is possible to achieve half the price of the deposit though if the UC bids for lower than
    that deposit (e.g. wants to dispense the waste for free) but this is not up
    to you.
</p>

<p>
    After this simple auction has been completed, you are directed to a wait
    page until every participant has completed their actions. Then you proceed 
    to the selling decision page, where you can see how much you now
    have in store, your remaining capacity and your balance. Your single decision 
    is on the number of items (if any in store) to sell to a recycling entity
    (RE). Note that the payoff you get by
    selling to an RE incurs a fixed cost of $15 for this service. Your revenue then
    equals a fixed price ($3) times the number of items you sell.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, once all CHs are done with their respective decisions, you are
    directed to the results page. There you will find a summary overview of
    your actions and the results. This includes how many items you have in
    storage, how many you sold to an RE, your payoff, from whom you bought
    which amount at which price, etc.

    Note that all decisions need to be taken within a certain time window.
